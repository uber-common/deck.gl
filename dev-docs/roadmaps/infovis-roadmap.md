# Infovis Roadmap

## Infovis Layers

Propose a `@deck.gl/infovis-layers` catalog. NOTE: infovis functionality has its own roadmap document.

### Node-link layer

Like geojson-layer, a composition of node (scatterplot, icon) and link (line, path, curve) layers

### Matrix layer

Basically a variation of the screen grid layer - geoEncode

## Math Layer Catalog?

Currently have not seen much demand but it would be nice to have some "math" visualization layers.

### Improved Plot Layer

### Complex Surface Layer

...

## Composable Base Layers

### Axis Layer

2D/3D
Scales, ticks etc.

### Grid Layer

Match axis layer with scales ticks etc.

## Implemented

### Ortographic Controller

Flat zoom and pan, fit bounds
