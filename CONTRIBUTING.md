## Contributing to deck.gl

**Thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

PRs and bug reports are welcome, and we are actively looking for new maintainers.


## Setting Up Dev Environment

The **master** branch is the active development branch.

Building deck.gl locally from the source requires node.js `10.x-12.12`.
We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to manage the dependencies of deck.gl.

```bash
git checkout master
yarn bootstrap
yarn test
```

Run the layer browser application:

```bash
cd examples/layer-browser
yarn
yarn start-local
```
