## Contributing to deck.gl

**Thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

PRs and bug reports are welcome, and we are actively looking for new maintainers.


## Setting Up Dev Environment

The **master** branch is the active development branch.

Building deck.gl locally from the source requires node.js `>=14`. Further limitations on the Node version may be imposed by [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer#usage) and [headless-gl](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl#supported-platforms-and-nodejs-versions).
We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to manage the dependencies of deck.gl.

```bash
git checkout master
yarn bootstrap
yarn test
```

Additional instructions for [Windows](/CONTRIBUTING.md#develop-on-windows).

Run the layer browser application:

```bash
cd examples/layer-browser
yarn
yarn start-local
```

## Troubleshooting

### Develop on Windows

It's possible to set up the dev environment in [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

To get OpenGL support, install [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/). In xlaunch.exe, choose multiple windows, display 0, start no client, disable native opengl. ([source](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2855#issuecomment-358861903))

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install mesa-utils
export DISPLAY=localhost:0
glxgears
```

If successful, you should see a window open with gears turning.

Next, install [headless-gl dependencies](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl#system-dependencies):

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libxi-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev pkg-config
```

Verify that everything works by running `yarn test node`.
