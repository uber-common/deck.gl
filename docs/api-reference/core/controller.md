# Controller

The base class for all viewport controllers.

A controller class can be passed to the `Deck.controller` or `View.controller` prop to specify viewport interactivity.


## Options

The base Controller class supports the following options:

* `scrollZoom` (Boolean|Object) - enable zooming with mouse wheel. Default `true`. If an object is supplied, it may contain the following fields to customize the zooming behavior:
  + `speed` (Number) - scaler that translates wheel delta to the change of viewport scale. Default `0.01`.
  + `smooth` (Boolean) - smoothly transition to the new zoom. If enabled, will provide a slightly lagged but smoother experience. Default `false`.
* `dragPan` (Boolean) - enable panning with pointer drag. Default `true`
* `dragRotate` (Boolean) - enable rotating with pointer drag. Default `true`
* `doubleClickZoom` (Boolean) - enable zooming with double click. Default `true`
* `touchZoom` (Boolean) - enable zooming with multi-touch. Default `true`
* `touchRotate` (Boolean) - enable rotating with multi-touch. Use two-finger rotating gesture for horizontal and three-finger swiping gesture for vertical rotation. Default `false`
* `keyboard` (Boolean|Object) - enable interaction with keyboard. Default `true`. If an object is supplied, it may contain the following fields to customize the keyboard behavior:
    * `zoomSpeed` (Number) - speed of zoom using +/- keys. Default `2`.
    * `moveSpeed` (Number) - speed of movement using arrow keys, in pixels.
    * `rotateSpeedX` (Number) - speed of rotation using shift + left/right arrow keys, in degrees. Default `15`.
    * `rotateSpeedY` (Number) - speed of rotation using shift + up/down arrow keys, in degrees. Default `10`.
* `dragMode` (String) - drag behavior without pressing function keys, one of `pan` and `rotate`.
* `inertia` (Boolean|Number) - Enable inertia after panning/pinching. If a number is provided, indicates the duration of time over which the velocity reduces to zero, in milliseconds. Default `false`.

## Methods

> A controller is not meant to be instantiated by the application. The following methods are documented for creating custom controllers that extend the base Controller class.

##### constructor

```js
import {Controller} from 'deck.gl';

class MyController extends Controller {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        super(MyViewState, options);
    }
}
```

The constructor takes two arguments:

* `ViewState` - a class that implements the following methods:
  - `getViewportProps()` - returns an object that describes the view state
  - `getInteractiveState()` - returns an object that contains the internal state of the ongoing interaction
  - `shortestPathFrom(viewState)` - returns an object that describes another view state that is closest to this view state. This is used by viewport transition when there are multiple equivalent ways to define a view state (e.g. `bearing: 240` and `bearing: -120`)
  - methods that return a new ViewState with updated props:
    + `panStart`
    + `pan`
    + `panEnd`
    + `rotateStart`
    + `rotate`
    + `rotateEnd`
    + `zoomStart`
    + `zoom`
    + `zoomEnd`
    + `zoomIn`
    + `zoomOut`
    + `moveLeft`
    + `moveRight`
    + `moveUp`
    + `moveDown`
    + `rotateLeft`
    + `rotateRight`
    + `rotateUp`
    + `rotateDown`
* `options` (Object) - options and view state props


##### `handleEvent(event)`

Called by the event manager to handle pointer events. This method delegate to the following methods to handle the default events:

* `_onPanStart(event)`
* `_onPan(event)`
* `_onPanEnd(event)`
* `_onPinchStart(event)`
* `_onPinch(event)`
* `_onPinchEnd(event)`
* `_onDoubleTap(event)`
* `_onWheel(event)`
* `_onKeyDown(event)`

##### `setProps(props)`

Called by the view when the view state updates. This method handles adding/removing event listeners based on user options.

##### `updateViewport(newMapState, extraProps, extraState)`

Called by the event handlers, this method updates internal state, and invokes `onViewStateChange` callback with a new map state.

##### `getCenter(event)`

Utility used by the event handlers, returns pointer position `[x, y]` from any event.

##### `isFunctionKeyPressed(event)`

Utility used by the event handlers, returns `true` if ctrl/alt/meta key is pressed during any event.

##### `isPointInBounds(pos, [event])`

Utility used by the event handlers, returns `true` if a pointer position `[x, y]` is inside the current view.

If `event` is provided, returns `false` if the event is already handled, and mark the event as handled if the point is in bounds. This can be used to make sure that certain events are only handled by one controller, when there are overlapping viewports.

##### `isDragging()`

Returns `true` if the user is dragging the view.



## Event Handling

A controller can specify a list of additional event names that this control subscribes to by adding them to the `events` field.

```js
import {Controller} from 'deck.gl';

class MyController extends Controller{
    constructor(options = {}) {
        super(MyViewState, options);
        this.events = ['pointermove'];
    }

    handleEvent(event) {
        if (event.type === 'pointermove') {
            // do something
        } else {
            super.handleEvent(event);
        }
    }
}
```

Available events: `click`, `dblclick`, `tap`, `doubletap`, `press`, `pinch`, `pinchin`, `pinchout`, `pinchstart`, `pinchmove`, `pinchend`, `pinchcancel`, `rotate`, `rotatestart`, `rotatemove`, `rotateend`, `rotatecancel`, `pan`, `panstart`, `panmove`, `panup`, `pandown`, `panleft`, `panright`, `panend`, `pancancel`, `swipe`, `swipeleft`, `swiperight`, `swipeup`, `swipedown`, `pointerdown`, `pointermove`, `pointerup`, `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`, `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `keydown`, and `keyup`.

The following events are toggled on/off based on user options:

* `scrollZoom` - `['wheel']`
* `dragPan` and `dragRotate` - `['panstart', 'panmove', 'panend']`
* `touchZoomRotate` - `['pinchstart', 'pinchmove', 'pinchend']`
* `doubleClickZoom` - `['doubletap']`
* `keyboar` - `['keydown']`

Event object is generated by [mjolnir.js](https://github.com/uber-web/mjolnir.js). It always has the following properties:

* `type` (string) -  The event type to which the event handler is subscribed, e.g. `'click'` or `'pointermove'`
* `center` (Object `{x, y}`) - The center of the event location (e.g. the centroid of a touch) relative to the viewport (basically, [`clientX/Y`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent/clientX))
* `offsetCenter` (Object `{x, y}`) - The center of the event location relative to the map.
* `target` (Object) - The target of the event, as specified by the original `srcEvent`
* `srcEvent` (Object) - The original event object dispatched by the browser to the JS runtime

Additionally, event objects for different event types contain a subset of the following properties:

* `key` (number) - The keycode of the keyboard event
* `leftButton` (boolean) - Flag indicating whether the left button is involved during the event
* `middleButton` (boolean) - Flag indicating whether the middle button is involved during the event
* `rightButton` (boolean) - Flag indicating whether the right button is involved during the event
* `pointerType` (string) - A string indicating the type of input (e.g. `'mouse'`, `'touch'`, `'pointer'`)
* `delta` (number) - The scroll magnitude/distance of a wheel event
