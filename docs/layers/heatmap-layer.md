# HeatmapLayer

`HeatmapLayer` can be used to visualize spatial distribution of data. It internally implements [Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics%29#Kernel_functions_in_common_use) to render heatmaps.

```js
import DeckGL from '@deck.gl/react';
import {HeatmapLayer} from '@deck.gl/aggregation-layers';

function App({data, viewState}) {
  /**
   * Data format:
   * [
   *   {COORDINATES: [-122.42177834, 37.78346622], WEIGHT: 10},
   *   ...
   * ]
   */
  const layer = new HeatmapLayer({
    id: 'heatmapLayer',
    getPosition: d => d.COORDINATES,
    getWeight: d => d.WEIGHT    
  });

  return <DeckGL viewState={viewState} layers={[layer]} />;
}
```


## Installation

To install the dependencies from NPM:

```bash
npm install deck.gl
# or
npm install @deck.gl/core @deck.gl/layers @deck.gl/aggregation-layers
```

```js
import {HeatmapLayer} from '@deck.gl/aggregation-layers';
new HeatmapLayer({});
```

To use pre-bundled scripts:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deck.gl@^8.0.0/dist.min.js"></script>
<!-- or -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@deck.gl/core@^8.0.0/dist.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@deck.gl/layers@^8.0.0/dist.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@deck.gl/aggregation-layers@^8.0.0/dist.min.js"></script>
```

```js
new deck.HeatmapLayer({});
```


## Properties

Inherits from all [Base Layer](/docs/api-reference/layer.md) and [CompositeLayer](/docs/api-reference/composite-layer.md) properties.

### Render Options

##### `radiusPixels` (Number, optional) ![transition-enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/transition-enabled-green.svg?style=flat-square")

* Default: `30`

Radius of the circle in pixels, to which the weight of an object is distributed.

##### `colorRange` (Array, optional)

* Default: <img src="/website/src/static/images/colorbrewer_YlOrRd_6.png"/>

Specified as an array of colors [color1, color2, ... color6]. Each color is an array of 3 or 4 values [R, G, B] or [R, G, B, A], representing Red, Green, Blue and Alpha channels.  Each channel is a value between 0 and 255. When Alpha is not provided, a value of 255 is used. By default `colorRange` is set to
[colorbrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=6) `6-class YlOrRd`.

##### `intensity` (Number, optional) ![transition-enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/transition-enabled-green.svg?style=flat-square")

* Default: `1`

Value that is multiplied with the total weight at a pixel to obtain the final weight. A value larger than `1` biases the output color towards the higher end of the spectrum, and a value less than `1` biases the output color towards the lower end of the spectrum.

##### `threshold` (Number, optional) ![transition-enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/transition-enabled-green.svg?style=flat-square")

* Default: `0.05`

The `HeatmapLayer` reduces the opacity of the pixels with relatively low weight to create a fading effect at the edge. A larger `threshold` smoothens the boundaries of color blobs, while making pixels with low relative weight harder to spot (due to low alpha value).

`threshold` is defined as the ratio of the fading weight to the max weight, between `0` and `1`. For example, `0.1` affects all pixels with weight under 10% of the max.

`threshold` is ignored when `colorDomain` is specified.

##### `colorDomain` (Array, optional) ![transition-enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/transition-enabled-green.svg?style=flat-square")

* Default: `null`

Weight of each data object is distributed to to all the pixels in a circle centered at the object position, weight a pixel receives is inversely proportional to its distance from the center. Pixels that fall into multiple circles will have sum of all weights. And the weight of the pixel determines its color. When `colorDomain` is specified, all pixels with weight with in specified `colorDomain` will get mapped to `colorRange`, pixels with weight less than `colorDomain[0]` will fade out (reduced alpha) and pixels with weight more than `colorDomain[1]` will mapped to the highest color in `colorRange`.

When not specified, maximum weight (`maxWeight`) is auto calculated and domain will be set to [`maxWeight * threshold`, `maxWeight`].

NOTES:
- It is recommend to use default value for regular use cases.
- On `Windows` browsers due to an ANGLE [issue](https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/issues/3554), auto calculation of maximum weight doesn't work, hence on `Windows`, `colorDomain` should be used with a non zero maximum value.

### Data Accessors

##### `getPosition` ([Function](/docs/developer-guide/using-layers.md#accessors), optional)

* Default: `object => object.position`

Method called to retrieve the position of each point.

##### `getWeight` ([Function](/docs/developer-guide/using-layers.md#accessors), optional)

* Default: `1`

Method called to retrieve weight of each point. By default each point will use a weight of `1`.
