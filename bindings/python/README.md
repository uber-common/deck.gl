*Python bindings for deck.gl*

Contents in `deck_bindings/components` provides a series of lightweight objects that can be combined to create a JSON blob that is compliant with the deck.gl JSON API.
Example of that JSON format is viewable [here](http://deck.gl/json/).

This directory will also provide convenience functions for plotting in Jupyter notebooks.
