Documentation example scripts
=============================

Helper scripts for generating pydeck documentation.

* `embed_examples.py` creates a series of .rst files with both embedded source code
   and an embedded example in them.
* `generate_grid_html.py` creates an HTML grid of links to those rst pages within thumbnails.
   It is the landing page for pydeck's website.
* `snap_thumbnails.py` creates the .png files used as those thumbnails from examples.
