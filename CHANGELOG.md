### Change Log
All notable changes to deck.gl will be documented in this file.

### Beta-3.0.0 Releases

#### [dev] -
- PERF: Enable Uint8Array attributes
  - Layer.instancePickingColors and Scatterplot.instanceColors now Uint8Arrays

#### [v3.0.0-beta31] - Stabilization/Performance round
- FIX: Scatterplot lineWidth warning
- FIX: context.viewport = null in draw
- FIX: opacity prop.
- FEATURE: Enables prop diff tracing (deck.log.priority = 1)
- PERF: Defeat spurious redraws

#### [v3.0.0-beta30] - Perf fixes - significantly reduce GPU load.
- FIX: compareProps and updateTriggers fixes
- PERF: reduce unnecessary updates
- Doc updates

#### [v3.0.0-beta29] -
- FIX: ArcLayer flickering last segments
- FIX: Scatterplot Layer exception
- FIX: Layer lifecycle - initialization/update of sublayers
- Doc update of Layers


#### [v3.0.0-beta28] -
- BREAKING CHANGE: Picking API final version. Fixes #115. Fixes #116.
- FIX: Ignore null layers
- FIX: Warns once instead of throws on deprecated props.
- FIX: Pinned babel-plugin-glslify version to avoid broken release
- Remove broken layers (HexagonLayer and PointCloudLayer).

#### [v3.0.0-beta27] - Broken
- npm publish failed, no dist

#### [v3.0.0-beta26] -
- FEATURE: line width now takes device pixel ratio into account
- FEATURE: New life cycle methods, old methods deprecated
- FIX: Fix for context.viewport initialization order
- FIX: `DeckGL` component now cancels animation loop on unmount.
- BREAKING: Removed `blending` prop from react components
- FIX: ScreenGridLayer
- FEATURE: ScreenGridLayer now have accessors (getPosition, getWeight) and custom
    color ramps (minColor, maxColor)

#### [v3.0.0-beta25] -
- FEATURE: Adds drawOutline option to ScatterplotLayer.
- FIX: update context.viewport issue #128

#### [3.0.0-beta24] -
- FIX: Picking in most layers
- FIX: Initialization of sublayers
- Exports more symbols from lib
- 64 bit ExtrudedChoroplethLayer
- 64 bit layers in place
- GLSL library alignement 64 bit projections

#### [3.0.0-beta23] -
 - FEATURE: `Layer.pick` lifecycle method - Let's layers take control of picking
 - FEATURE: Support for Composite Layers
 - FEATURE: new GeoJsonLayer - Initial composite layer, only Polygons for now.
 - BREAKING: Introducing `context` that is shared between layers.
    gl and viewport moved from state to context. This implies that apps
    no longer need to pass {lng,lat,zoom,pitch,bearing} to each layer, only
    to the `DeckGL` react component.
 - BREAKING: GridLayer renamed to ScreenGridLayer
 - BREAKING: All layers now use `assembleShaders`
 - BREAKING: GLSL `project` package - shader functions renamed to have
