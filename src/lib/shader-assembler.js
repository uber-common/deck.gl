// IMLEMENTATION NOTES: Why new layers are created on every render
//
// The key here is to understand the declarative / functional
// programming nature of "reactive" applications.
//
// - In a reactive application, the entire "UI tree"
//   is re-rendered every time something in the application changes.
//
// - The UI framework (such as React or deck.gl) then diffs the rendered
//   tree of UI elements (React Elements or deck.gl Layers) against the
//   previously tree and makes optimized changes (to the DOM or to WebGL state).
//
// - Deck.gl layers are not based on React.
//   But it should be possible to wrap deck.gl layers in React components to
//   enable use of JSX.
//
// The deck.gl model that for the app creates a new set of on layers on every
// render.
// Internally, the new layers are efficiently matched against existing layers
// using layer ids.
//
// All calculated state (programs, attributes etc) are stored in a state object
// and this state object is moved forward to the match layer on every render
// cycle.  The new layer ends up with the state of the old layer (and the
// props of the new layer), while the old layer is simply discarded for
// garbage collecion.
