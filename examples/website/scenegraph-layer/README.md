This is a standalone demo of the [scenegraph layer](./scenegraph-layer) built upon [deck.gl](http://deck.gl). This example illustrates the scenegraph layer features.

### Usage
Copy the content of this folder to your project. Run
```
npm install
npm start
```
### Note on "Map Tokens"
This example is set up to read the token from the environment variable
`MapboxAccessToken`, so you don't have to edit the code to test them.
